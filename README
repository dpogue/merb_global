= merb_global

A plugin for the Merb framework providing Localization (L10n) and 
Internationalization (i18n) support.
 
merb_global will have the following feature set:
    * support for model (content) localization
        - by default, localization stored in the database
            - with DataMapper   (targeted 0.1)
            - with ActiveRecord (targeted 0.2)
            - with Sequel ORM   
          and, with a choice of strategies in each case:
            - single-table  (c.f. globalize RoR plugin)
                |title   |varchar(100)|
                |title_de|varchar(100)|
                |title_fr|varchar(100)|
            - joined-table for unlimited localizations (c.f. Symfony PHP)
        - or, alternatively localizations can be stored outside of the domain 
        model, UI Strings.
        
    * support for view (UI String) localization
        - choice of providers (po, yaml, database)
            Merb::Plugins.config[:merb_global] = {
              #:provider => "po",   # default
              :provider => 'yaml'
              #:provider => activerecord
              #:provider => datamapper
              #:provider => sequel
            }
        - for JRuby, wrapper allowing use of .properties files.
    
    * Extract, update for PO/ POT files
    * Currency, Date and Language Helpers
        - stored either in the database, or for JRuby, wrappers around
        built-in functionality provided by java.util.Currency, java.util.Locale
        
    * support for localization of Merb generated code
    * support for non-English Inflectors.
